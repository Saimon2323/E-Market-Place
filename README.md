# E-Marketplace "Ghuri"

This is a multi-vendor e-commerce website like Daraz. This is our Software development project in the Sixth Semester.

There are two types of accounts you can create. Those are 'Business account' and 'Personal account'. By creating a Business account, any seller can create their own shop and sell their specific products. Customers can search for their desired products categorically and also able to give feedback. There is also a community page where any login user can create posts and comment on services, products and other contents. I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL for this.
